Such reptilin are less versed in their native ways but gain a flexibility of thought and horizon that their forebears lacked.</em></p><p><em>Resembling an elfin humanoid from the waist up and a long snake from there down, a reptilin carries few traits of the seemingly mixed heritage because they have actually evolved directly from snakes with the aid of magic. Strong and fierce warriors, the snake-people of Everglow are new to the world at large but are increasingly seeing their own place within it.</em></p><p><em>Tending toward a neutral approach to life, a reptilin leans toward aloofness in all things social but, when matters are reduced to choice regarding life or death, are brutally ruthless.</em></p>",
